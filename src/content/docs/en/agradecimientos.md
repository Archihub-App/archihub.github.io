This development benefits from the experience in the administration of archives of various public entities in Colombia, such as the National Center of Historical Memory, the Museum of Memory, the Art, Science and Technology Line of IDARTES, the General Archive of the Nation, the Truth Commission and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. To all these entities and the teams that made them up, a special thanks for making this possible, for contributing their knowledge and comments to test and improve the application.

This development was not only possible thanks to the contribution of the teams, but also to the institutional support of various entities, especially the Truth Commission, which invested in a multidisciplinary team and opened spaces for discussion and collaboration that inspired and made possible the development of this project.

The documentation you are seeing now is thanks to the impeccable work of [Jonnier](https://github.com/jonniermartinez).
