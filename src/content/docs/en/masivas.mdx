ArchiHUB makes bulk document uploads easy with a script that respects your system's folder hierarchy. This guide will show you how to set up and use this tool to efficiently migrate large volumes of documents.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed on your system
- An ArchiHUB admin key (learn how to generate one [here](../profile/keys))

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**

   Download the repository containing the upload scripts:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArchiHUB-App/getting-started.git
   ```

2. **Configure API credentials**

   Navigate to the scripts folder and create a configuration file:
   
   ```bash
   cd getting-started/scripts
   touch .env
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Open the `.env` file and add the following lines, replacing with your credentials:
   
   ```
   ARCHIHUB_API_KEY="your-admin-key"
   ARCHIHUB_API_URL="http://localhost:11000/adminApi"
   ```

4. **Set up Python environment**

   Create and activate a virtual environment to install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv folder_load
   source folder_load/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the upload script**

   Navigate to the scripts folder and run the upload command. Make sure to adjust the path according to your configuration:
   
   ```bash
   cd getting-started/scripts
   python3 folder_load.py --folder /path/to/your/folder --publish true
   ```

</Steps>

## Script Parameters

The bulk upload script accepts the following parameters:

### Required Parameters

- `--folder`
  - **Description**: Absolute path to the root folder containing the documents to upload.
  - **Example**: `/full/path/to/your/folder`
  - **Note**: The folder structure will be preserved in ArchiHUB.

### Optional Parameters

- `--publish`
  - **Description**: Automatically publishes the uploaded documents.
  - **Values**: `true` or `false`
  - **Default**: `false` (documents are saved as drafts)
  - **Recommendation**: Use `true` for production, `false` for testing.

## Practical Example

Suppose you have the following folder structure:

```
Documents/
├── Project A/
│   ├── Contract.pdf
│   └── Budget.xlsx
└── Project B/
    ├── Invoice.pdf
    └── Receipt.pdf
```

To upload these documents while maintaining the structure, you would use:

```bash
python3 folder_load.py --folder /path/to/Documents --publish true
```

If you want to upload the example folder included in the repository, you can use the following command (adjust the path according to your system):

```bash
cd getting-started/scripts
python3 folder_load.py --folder ~/dev/archihub/getting-started/scripts/Assets --publish true
```

This command will upload the contents of the `Assets` folder, which includes sample files to test the functionality.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Error**: Verify that the API key in the `.env` file is correct.
- **Path Not Found**: Make sure the path specified in `--folder` exists.
- **Permission Denied**: Check that you have write permissions for the target folder.
