The video download plugin allows you to download videos from YouTube directly from ArchiHUB. To access this plugin from ArchiHUB, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install the plugin from the ArchiHUB repository**: to install the video download plugin, you must clone the [plugin repository](https://github.com/ArchiHUB-App/videoDownloader) into the `plugins` folder of the application following the steps indicated in the [plugin installation](../install_plugin) section.
2. **Configure the necessary permissions**: make sure your account has the necessary permissions to use the plugin. The `processing` permission is required.
3. **Log in to your account from ArchiHUB**: once the plugin is installed and configured, access the ArchiHUB interface and go to the processing tab. If the video download plugin is not enabled, you must enable it from the settings tab and then restart the application.
4. **Download videos**: once the plugin is enabled, select the videos you want to download and configure the plugin options:
    - **Parent resource**: select the parent resource where the downloaded video will be saved.
    - **Video URL**: paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.
    - **Save audio only**: if this option is enabled, the plugin will download only the audio of the video.

Once the options are configured, click the `PROCESS` button. The downloaded video will be available in the selected parent resource.
