![My profile configuration form](/archihub.github.io/imagenes/perfil_config.png)

From the __My profile__ tab you have several options that indicate your personal settings on file. The first of these options allows you to modify and configure basic aspects of your profile. From here you can configure the name of your user and the name that others will see in the platform, as well as update and change your user's password.

When changing the settings, the application will ask you for your current password and will validate the information.
