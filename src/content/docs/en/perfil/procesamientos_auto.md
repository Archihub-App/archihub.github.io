If you remember the first steps we took to set up your archive, you will recall that we set the File Processing plugin to run every time a resource was created or updated. These are tasks that run automatically and do not need your intervention. Just like the processing that you run yourself, the ones that the system runs automatically are organized in the automatic processing view in your profile.

This option is only available to administrators, who can see all tasks automatically executed by any user.
