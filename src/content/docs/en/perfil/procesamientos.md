![Processing view](/archihub.github.io/imagenes/procesamientos_vista.png)

From the processing tab you can see the processing that you activate from the plugins menu. From this view, you will be able to know the status of the processing, if it is already finished, and to see the result in case the plugin has it enabled.

As you can see in the image, there are two finished processes. The first one is the plugin process to process the files, and the second one is the one to generate the inventories. For the latter, you can download the result of the processing, in this case, an Excel file with the inventory.

## Execution permissions

Remember that for a user to have access to this menu and to the processing, it is imperative that he/she has the `processing` role.
