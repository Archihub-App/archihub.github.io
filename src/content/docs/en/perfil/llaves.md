ArchiHub allows you to expand its capabilities through the use of various APIs. Depending on the roles enabled for your user, you can generate keys that grant access to your tools to interact with the archive. From administration to visualization dashboards, here we will see the details for each one.

## Key for system administration

This key allows you to access the administration API, with it you can create or update resources. It is valid for two days and is only available to users with an `admin` role. Each time you generate a new key, previously generated keys are disabled.

## Key for public API access

This key allows you to have access to the public API of the platform for your own interfaces and interactions with the content. It is available to all users with a weekly or unlimited limit.
