Learn how it works, discover its key features and see how it can transform the way you manage and protect your digital files.

## 🌿 Archihub and document archives.

ArchiHUB is a flexible tool that allows you to organize and adapt virtual archives for online consultation, through an API, and execute a wide range of processing such as: automatic transcription, document and image segmentation, text processing using LLMs, NER, OCR, among many others.
In addition, ArchiHUB offers the possibility to perform backups both in the cloud and locally, ensuring the integrity and preservation of digital files. The tool organizes the information and makes available various ways to query, either using semantic or keyword search, cataloging filters or automatic description of the information.

## 🌿 Archihub and hydroponic gardening

In the case of the hydroponic vegetable garden, Archihub has been used to organize the data and spin a story about the growth of the plants. 📊
It is a meticulous collection of real-world data deposited in an archive and beginning to weave a narrative: a chronicle of the planet and the extraordinary uniqueness it embodies. 🌍✨
