It is important to note that there are minimum hardware requirements to be able to run the application depending on the tools to be used. Below is a table describing the different functions and their corresponding minimum requirements.

| Description | Requirements |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| __Cataloging module__: This functionality allows cataloging and organizing new resources based on a form described by the user. Processing must be limited to one at a time to avoid overloading the machine. | __4GB RAM__ |
| __Advanced search__ with cross-referencing of information related to word processing, OCR, transcription and automatic labeling. | __16GB RAM__|

## Docker installation on the machine

To install ArchiHUB on a local machine, it is necessary to have the Docker application installed on the operating system (either Mac or Windows). Docker is a tool that allows to virtualize the different services necessary for the correct operation of the archive. Throughout this guide, it will be shown how to use this tool to start up the archive, perform backups and update the tool.

- [MAC Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Linux installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Download ArchiHUB

The ArchiHUB system is composed of two main components:  
- **Backend**: An API that serves as the system's foundation  
- **Frontend**: An interchangeable component that can be adapted according to specific needs  

Currently, there is a version of the frontend that manages all processing and file management tasks. However, this implementation does not limit the system, as it allows the development of custom interfaces according to each user's requirements.

### Installation preparation

This repository centralizes the different ways to install ArchiHUB. For our case, we will need the files located in the `local-machine` folder.

**Important**: Before starting, you must:
1. Update the access keys
2. Adjust security settings

This will ensure that the installation is secure and works correctly from the start.

### Environment configuration

Follow these steps to prepare the environment:

<Steps>

1. Download the repository with installation scripts

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArchiHUB-App/getting-started
   ```

2. Go to the archihub folder
   ```bash
   cd getting-started/local-machine/archihub
   ```

3. Rename the .env.bak file to .env
   ```bash
   mv .env.back .env
   ```

</Steps>

Make sure to adjust the following settings in this file so that everything works correctly:

- __Line 7__: _MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD_ is the environment variable that assigns a password to the database. 
- __Line 11__: _ELASTIC_PASSWORD_ is the environment variable that assigns a password to the elasticsearch index. 
- __Line 29 and 30__: _SECRET_KEY_ and _JWT_SECRET_KEY_ are for the application login keys. 
- __Line 31__: _FERNET_KEY_ is the key used to encrypt our API access keys.

### Folder organization

 ```
├── local-machine
│   ├── archihub
│   │   ├── frontend
│   │   ├── backend
│   │   ├── mongo_db
│   ├── webfiles
│   ├── userfiles
│   ├── temporal
│   ├── original
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── mongodb
│   │   ├── elastic
 ```

 The root folder consists of the following folders, if they don't exist they must be created:
 - __archihub__: in this folder we find the _frontend_ code, the _backend_ we must download or clone from the repository, and in _mongo_db_ we find the initial configuration of the application to load into a fresh database installation.
 - __webfiles__: ArchiHUB supports a wide variety of documents that you can upload without worrying about the format. To facilitate viewing and standardize formats, our tool takes care of generating web versions of the documents. This allows you to access and view your files consistently and smoothly, regardless of the original format.
 - __userfiles__: this folder stores files generated by users, such as mass processing reports or inventories requested from the cataloging module.
 - __temporal__: for some processing cases it is necessary to manipulate temporary files, this folder is used for that.
 - __original__: the original files of the documents are stored here. They are stored in a temporary folder structure and the path of the original is the same as that of the web versions.
 - __data__: this is the persistent data from both the database and the index. This folder is for system use only and should not be modified.

### Download the application backend

As we mentioned before, it is necessary to download the backend code from the [repository](https://github.com/ArchiHUB-App/archihub-backend) of the project. You can do it in two ways:

<Steps>

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArchiHUB-App/archihub-backend.git backend
   ```
   This command must be executed inside the `/local-machine/archihub/` folder and will create a folder named "backend".

2. Or download the zip
   ![download from github](/archihub.github.io/imagenes/descarga_git.gif)

</Steps>

This will allow you to get all the necessary code to configure and run the ArchiHUB backend.

### Starting the application

<Steps>

1. Execute the deployment command
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This command will start the deployment of all necessary services.

2. Verify the status of the services
   You can verify the status in two ways:

   **Option 1 - Docker Desktop:**
   - Open the Docker Desktop application
   - Go to the "Containers" tab
   - Verify that __archihub__ appears as active

   **Option 2 - Terminal:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   This command will show all active containers. You should see the ArchiHUB containers in the list.

3. Access the application
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
   - The installation may take a few minutes, be patient

</Steps>

> **Note:** If the services don't appear as active, wait a few minutes and check again. The first installation may take longer.

The default user for this installation is __beta__ and the password is __beta__.

Once you're ready, we can continue with the [first steps](../pasos) in ArchiHUB.
