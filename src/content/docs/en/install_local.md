It is important to note that there are minimum hardware requirements to be able to run the application depending on the tools to be used. Below is a table describing the different functions and their corresponding minimum requirements.

| Description | Requirements |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| __Cataloging module__: This functionality allows cataloging and organizing new resources based on a form described by the user. Processing must be limited to one at a time to avoid overloading the machine. | __4GB RAM__ |
| __Advanced search__ with cross-referencing of information related to word processing, OCR, transcription and automatic labeling. | __16GB RAM__|

## Docker installation on the machine

To install ArchiHUB on a local machine, it is necessary to have the Docker application installed on the operating system (either Mac or Windows). Docker is a tool that allows to virtualize the different services necessary for the correct operation of the archive. Throughout this guide, it will be shown how to use this tool to start up the archive, perform backups and update the tool.

- [MAC Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Linux installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Download ArchiHUB

The ArchiHUB system is composed of two main parts: a backend and a frontend. The backend, being an API, allows the frontend to be an interchangeable component. Currently, there is a version of the frontend that executes all tasks related to archive processing and management. However, this configuration does not restrict the use of the system, since it is possible to develop an interface adapted to the specific needs of each user, depending on their requirements. We will now detail the steps to follow for installation using _docker compose_. The first step is to clone or download the [repository](https://github.com/Archihub-App/getting-started) with the installation scripts:

```
git clone https://github.com/Archihub-App/getting-started
```

In this repository we find centralized the different ways in which we can start our ArchiHUB installation. For our specific case, we will need the content of the _local-machine_ folder. Before starting the installation process, it is crucial that you update the login keys and adjust some security settings. This will ensure that your installation is secure and that everything runs smoothly from the start.

### Environment configuration

To begin, you must go to the /local-machine/archihub folder and create a new .env file by copying the contents found in the .env.back file. You can use the text editor of your choice to perform this task. Be sure to adjust the following settings in this file so that everything works correctly:

- __Line 7__: _MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD_ is the environment variable that assigns a password to the database. [Link to randomly generate a password](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=30&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new).
- __Line 11__: _ELASTIC_PASSWORD_ is the environment variable that assigns a password to the index of elasticsearch. [Link to randomly generate a password](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=30&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new).
- __Line 29 y 30__: _SECRET_KEY_ y _JWT_SECRET_KEY_ are for the keys to enter the application. [Link to randomly generate a password](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=30&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new).
- __Line 31__: _FERNET_KEY_ is the key used to encrypt our API access keys. [Link to generate fernet key](https://fernetkeygen.com/).

### Folder organization

 ```
├── local-machine
│   ├── archihub
│   │   ├── frontend
│   │   ├── backend
│   │   ├── mongo_db
│   ├── webfiles
│   ├── userfiles
│   ├── temporal
│   ├── original
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── mongodb
│   │   ├── elastic
 ```

 The root of the folder is composed of the following folders, if they do not exist they must be created:
 - __archihub__: in this folder we find the _frontend_ code, the _backend_ we must download or clone it from the repository and in _mongo_db_ we find the initial configuration of the application to load to a fresh installation of the database.
 - __webfiles__: ArchiHUB supports a wide variety of documents that you can upload without worrying about the format. To facilitate viewing and standardize formats, our tool takes care of generating web versions of the documents. This allows you to access and view your files consistently and smoothly, regardless of the original format.
 - __userfiles__: this folder stores files generated by users, such as mass processing reports or inventories requested from the cataloging module.
 - __temporal__: for some processing cases it is necessary to manipulate temporary files, this folder is used for that.
 - __original__: the original files of the documents are stored here. They are stored in a temporary folder structure and the path of the original is the same as that of the web versions.
 - __data__: this is the persistent data from both the database and the index. This folder is for system use only and should not be modified.

### Download the application backend

As we mentioned before, it is necessary to download the backend code from the [repository](https://github.com/Archihub-App/archihub-backend) of the project. You can do it in two ways:

- __Cloning the repository__: Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository, this should be inside the `/local-machine/archihub/` folder with the folder name "backend". <br>
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Archihub-App/archihub-backend.git backend
    ```
- __Downloading the zip file__: <br>![download from github](/archihub.github.io/imagenes/descarga_git.gif)

This will allow you to get all the necessary code to configure and run the ArchiHUB backend.

### Starting the application

When we have the environment variables configured and the folders ready, we are ready to start the application using Docker. For this it is necessary to open a terminal and go to the folder where the File tool is located. To do this, type `cd ` _(!! do not forget the space at the end)_ in the terminal and drag the __archihub__ folder to the terminal.

![view open folder in terminal](/archihub.github.io/imagenes/terminal.gif)

Press “Enter” and then copy and paste the command `docker compose up -d` and “Enter” to accept. The deployment of the services will start. To check the status of the services, you can open the Docker application and go to the “Containers” tab. There you should see __archihub__ as active.

Usually the installation can take a few minutes. When you are ready you can go to the following link using your browser: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

Once you are ready we can continue with the [first steps](../pasos) in ArchiHUB.
