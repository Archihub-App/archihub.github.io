The plugin allows exporting inventories in ArchiHUB. This plugin is included by default in the application and does not need to be installed. The plugin enables exporting an inventory of the resources in ArchiHUB in Excel. Below are the steps to generate an inventory:

## Generate Inventory

1. **Access the Plugin**: To access the inventory generation plugin, go to the processing tab in the ArchiHUB interface and select the `BULK PROCESSING` button of the export inventories plugin.
2. **Select the Resource**: Select the resource for which you want to generate the inventory.
3. **Export Inventory**: Once you have selected the resource, click the `PROCESS` button. The plugin will create a processing task, and the inventory will be available in the tasks tab once the task is completed.
4. **Download Inventory**: Once the task is completed, go to the tasks tab in your profile and click the `DOWNLOAD` button to download the inventory in Excel format.

For the usage of the plugin, it is important to have at least one processing row available, as this is necessary for executing tasks related to file processing. To create a processing row or validate its existence, review the documentation on [processing rows](../nodes).
